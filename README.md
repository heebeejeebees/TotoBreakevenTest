# My first personal project ever and my first foray into coding
Went through some tutorials on java from youtube and decided to try something

# Purpose
To find out if there is a possibility of breaking even on Toto (Toto is a legalised form of lottery sold in Singapore)

# Details
Winning numbers and user numbers are randomly generated, prize structure is coded in and user has control over budget used for the test and which 'System' (Toto allows for the buyer to select 6-12 numbers, with varying costs) to test under.

To ensure realism, past history statistics are used (via webscraper and multithreading to ensure reasonable completion time)

# Bugs (of which there were many)
While I would like to say this code was bug free, the entire journey was hell trying to debug the multi threading portion (other parts of the project were pretty enjoyable), there still exists a bug where the webscraped statistics would be off by a tiny amount each run (decided to end the project here as I ran out of ideas on why it would be so, i met a brickwall debugging with no teacher in sight)

# Takeaways
1) Try an easier project next time (or at least within scope of what I learnt, webscraping and multi threading were brand new concepts I had to google partway through....)
2) Learning via doing is the best, will be posting more personal projects here I as continue learning
